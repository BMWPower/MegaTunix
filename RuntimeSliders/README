This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, Dec 2nd 23:12 PM

Inside this dir (RuntimeSliders) are files with an .rts_conf extension.  They
are ASCII text files in .ini file format, using the common "section", 
"key", and "value" layout as shown below.

[section]
key=value

The rts_conf files define all of the sliders shown on the Runtime and 
Warmup-Wizard and VE3D pages.  They get their data from the RealTimeMaps (rtv_map)


NOTES regarding the files:

- The value names are CaSe SeNsItIvE, so be warned.  Ironically the
keys themselves are not, as the string compare functions are case insensitive.

[global] section
contains a "description" key (not really used in the code, but may be in the 
future
Also contains two more interger keys, rt_total_sliders, and ww_total_sliders
defining the total number of sliders on the runtime and warmup wizard tabs
respectively.

Following that are sections for each slider.

The sections are named [rt_slider_xx], rt for runtime,ww for warmup wizard and
ve3d for the 3E VEtable viewer/editor.
the xx is a number starting at 0 and going up to rt/ww_total_sliders-1 
(since we start from 0 not 1)

Inside each section are 4 keys;
slider_name	[string] name used to refer to this control
table		[integer] a table number in the window tab (or zero for warmup
		wizard), tables are arranged as follows (runtime tab):
		Table number can be 0 or 1 for the ve3d_rt_sliders as there
		are two tables (left and right column)
		Runtime tab uses 4 tables
			[table 0][table 1]
			[table 2][table 3]
		Warmup Wizard uses only 1 table
		VE3D Viewer PAge uses two tables
			[table 0][table 1]
row		[integer], row of above table this control appears on.  You
		should NEVER put two sliders on the same table/row as they
		will cause a gui error.
source		[string]  This is the datasource name,  you get these from 
		looking into the RealTimeMap file and looking for the 
		"internal_name" key for the variable you're interested in.  
		Everything else is automagic. This is CaSe SenSiTiVe just so
		you know....
