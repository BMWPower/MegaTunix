This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, Dec 2nd 23:12 PM

Inside this dir (RuntimeSliders) are files with an .rts_conf extension.  They
are ASCII text files in .ini file format, using the common "section", 
"key", and "value" layout as shown below.

[section]
key=value

The rts_conf files define all of the sliders shown on the Runtime and 
WarmupWizard tabs.  They get their data from the RealTimeMaps (rtv_map)


NOTES regarding the files:

- The value names are CaSe SeNsItIvE, so be warned.  Ironically the
keys themselves are not, as the string compare functions are case insensitive.

[global] section
contains a "description" key (not really used in the code, but may be in the 
future
Also contains two more interger keys, rt_total_sliders, and ww_total_sliders
defining the total number of sliders on the runtime and warmup wizard tabs
respectively.

Following that are sections for each slider.

The sections are named [rt_slider_xx], rt for runtime or ww for warmup wizard.
the xx is a number starting at 0 and going up to rt/ww_total_sliders-1 
(since we start from 0 not 1)

Inside each section are 4 keys;
slider_name	[string] name used to refer to this control
table		[integer] a table number in the runtime tab (or zero for warmup
		wizard), tables are arranged as follows (runtime tab):
		[table 0][table 1]
		[table 2][table 3]
row		[integer], row of above table this control appears on.  You
		should NEVER put two sliders on the same table/row as they
		will cause a gui error.
source		[string]  This is the datasource name,  you get these from 
		looking into the RealTimeMap file and looking for the 
		"internal_name" key for the variable you're interested in.  
		Everything else is automagic. This is CaSe SenSiTiVe just so
		you know....

If you want to modify the sliders for your own use, copy this file to
~/.MegaTunix/RuntimeSliders and edit to taste. I suggest submitting the file
to the author for inclusion into the official distribution though. After 
interrogation is completed, the file search routine will look in your 
homedir FIRST for files so even if the name isn't changed megatunix
will prefer the file in your homedir over the system wide one...
