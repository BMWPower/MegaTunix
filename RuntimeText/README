This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, Feb 1 2007

Inside this dir (RuntimeText) are files with an .rtt_conf extension.  They
are ASCII text files in .ini file format, using the common "section", 
"key", and "value" layout as shown below.

[section]
key=value

The rtt_conf files define all of the text values shown on the floating 
window.  They get their data from the RealTimeMaps (rtv_map)


NOTES regarding the files:

- The value names are CaSe SeNsItIvE, so be warned.  Ironically the
keys themselves are not, as the string compare functions are case insensitive.

[global] section
contains a "description" key (not really used in the code, but may be in the 
future
Also contains two more interger keys, rtt_total, 
defining the total number of vars displayed on the floating window.
respectively.

Following that are sections for each text variable.

The sections are named [rt_text_xx], 
the xx is a number starting at 0 and going up to rt_total-1 
(since we start from 0 not 1)

Inside each section are 2 keys;
int_name	[string] internal name used to refer to this control
source		[string]  This is the datasource name,  you get these from 
		looking into the RealTimeMap file and looking for the 
		"internal_name" key for the variable you're interested in.  
		Everything else is automagic. This is CaSe SenSiTiVe just so
		you know....
