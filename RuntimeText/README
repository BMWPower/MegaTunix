This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, July 2010

Inside this dir (RuntimeText) are files with an .xml extension.  They
are relatively simple, use syntax like the following:
The "internal_name" key is a string to define this value and they should
be unique, otherwise a duplication will overwrite a previous one.
The "datasource" key IS important, and must be one of the ones from
the realtime map files (see internal names)

        <rtt>
               <internal_name>rpm</internal_name>
               <datasource>rpm</datasource>
        </rtt>
