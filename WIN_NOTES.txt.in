 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@ NO LONGER requires a separate GTK+ Runtime.

 If you still have it installed from a Previous version of MegaTunix,
 its recommended that you UNINSTALL IT so it doesn't not conflict
 with the integrated one within this installer.

 NOTE: Windows 2000 will be phased out at some point.  The author
 strongly recommends moving to a more modern platform. We suggest 
 you use a Linux (Ubuntu recommended) or WinXP machine instead.
