 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@ NO LONGER requires a separate GTK+ Runtime.

 IF you have a GTK+ Runtime installed, cancel this install and then
 UNINSTALL IT FIRST, and reboot before resuming the MegaTunix install!

 NOTE: Windows 2000 has been phased out. Please use Windows XP or Linux
 for an optimal user experience.
