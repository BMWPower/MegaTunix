 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@@WIN32_SUBRELEASE@ requires the GTK+ Runtime.

 If you are running a Windows 9x OS (Win95, 98, ME, NT) Then you MUST
 have the GTK+ runtime 2.6.x installed.

 If you run Windows 2000 or newer (2k, XP, 2k03) you will need a newer
 version of the GTK+ Runtime, in the 2.10.x series

 MegaTunix WILL NOT RUN until the appropriate runtime above is installed.
