 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@@WIN32_SUBRELEASE@ requires the GTK+ Runtime.

 If you are running a Windows 9x OS (Win95, 98, ME, NT) then you are 
 unfortunately out of luck.  MegaTunix requires either:
 Linux
 Windows 2000 or newer.
 OS-X (and supporting toolkits via MacPorts/DarwinPorts.

 If you run Windows 2000 or newer (2k, XP, 2k03) you will need the GTK+ 
 runtime,  preferrably 2.12.9 or newer

 http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-2.12.9-win32-2.exe

 MegaTunix WILL NOT RUN until the appropriate runtime above is installed.
