 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@ NO LONGER requires the GTK+ Runtime.

 If you still have it installed from a Previous version of MegaTunix,
 its recommended that you UNINSTALL IT so it doesn't not conflict
 with the integrated one within this installer


NOTE: As of MegaTunix 0.9.23 and later , due to limitations in 
Windows 2000, it is no longer supported.  Pleas consider using 
Linux (Ubuntu reocmmended), WinXP or newer, or OS-X.
