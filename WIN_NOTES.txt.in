 MegaTunix v. @VERSION@ NO LONGER requires a separate GTK+ Runtime.

 If you still have it installed from a Previous version of MegaTunix,
 its recommended that you UNINSTALL IT so it doesn't not conflict
 with the integrated one within this installer.

 NOTE: Windows 2000 has been deprecated as of MEgaTunix 0.9.23.  
 Only MegaTunix.exe itself will run, however the other tools will 
 NOT as they require the current 2.20 GK+ version which has an 
 incompatibility iwht Win2k's winsock implementation.  We suggest 
 you use a Linux (Ubuntu recommended) or WinXP machine instead.
