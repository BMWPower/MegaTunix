MegaTunix x.y.z. designed and written by Dave J. Andruczyk

Insiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel injection ECU. This code is 
modelled slightly after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for MS-Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgrens' MegaTune,
also for windows.

Currently all Serial I/O is working. Reading of Realtime vars works.  
Reading of VEtable/Constants works fine.  Changing any var checks for limits
and sends right to the MS (new as of 5/25/2003). Flash burn works..

The only things not done yet are the Tuning gui (guages, VEtable graphical
editor..) and the datalogging/tools pages.
