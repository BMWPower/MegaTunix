MegaTunix x.y.z. designed and written by Dave J. Andruczyk

Inspiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel Injection ECU.  This code is 
modelled slightly after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgrens' MegaTune,
also for Windows.

NOTE about fonts:
	Some people have complained that MegaTunix comes up with abnormally
huge fonts.  This is NOT MegaTunix's fault.  It's caused by the default font
for Gnome being set to large.  This problem is mostly seen by people NOT 
using the Gnome desktop.   MegaTunix uses the GTK+2 libraries which are the 
foundation libraries by which Gnome's gui is based upon.  The fix is to run 
"gnome-font-properties" and set the "Application Font" size to a smaller 
point size.  On the authors' system a Application Font of "Sans" at 8pt, 
looks the best.  The author runs at 1600x1200 on an ancient 21 inch monitor 
so your ideal font size may vary.

	Currently all Serial I/O is working. Reading of Realtime vars works.  
Reading of VEtable/Constants works fine.  Changing any var checks for limits
and sends directly to the MS (new as of 5/25/2003). Flash burn works..

The only things not done yet are the Tuning gui (guages, VEtable graphical
editor..) and the datalogging/tools pages.

Suggestions are welcomed for improving the functionality of MegaTunix...
