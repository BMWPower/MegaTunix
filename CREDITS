Albert Fletcher < unknown >
	Most generously donated a Apple G4 Mac Mini to be used for 
	megatunix on PPC testing and improvement, which is used to test 
	all OS-X builds.
	
A special note of Thanks goes out to Jerry and the kind folks at:
diyautotune.com, who graciously dontated a JimStim 1.3 to me to help me
out with debugging megatunix's TTM (Tooth/Trigger Monitor).
