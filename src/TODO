Tools (reqd fuel calc, memory editor, TPS guage calibrator)
Datalogging gui and necessary I/O functions. (will draw upon eXtace code)

serial output routines for burning changes to the MS need to be written.
Most of the prelim code is already in place.  all that is needed is the 
write function.  Waiting to get final confirm from Bruce on some details 
before enabling it, as I don't want to hose my MS's yet... :)

Still needs tuning GUI.  Will probably end up starting yet another project
to design gui dashboard widgets for GTK and make a library for it..  Would
prefer to find out someone else alreay built it, and did it right...
