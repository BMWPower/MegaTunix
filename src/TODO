Tools (memory editor, TPS guage calibrator, others? )
Datalogging gui and necessary I/O functions. (will draw upon existing code)

Still needs tuning GUI.  Will probably end up starting yet another project
to design gui dashboard widgets for GTK and make a library for it..  Would
prefer to find out someone else alreay built it, and did it right...
Currently leaning towards libgnomecanvas. The Canvas seems extremely power-
full, though I'd like to see more documentation on it...  Now that flash
burn works, I'll begin working on that...

Find a way to make MegaTunix "template-able" so that it can easily load
profiles for the different MS variants already out there like:
	MS Version 1 or 2
	Ms with Dual Table
	MS with high-res code
	MegaSquirt AVR (Amtel reimplementation)
	Others?

Probably will be very difficult for the gui,  The only easily template-able
things will the be commands for the various ops (read realtime, read VE,
write VE, check version, etc..) and the data arguments (size of block, 
formatting, etc...)
This is currently on hold indefinitely until a better idea comes along that
is actually doable...

Use gtkglext to display the VEtable in OpenGL. (should be too cpu intensive
as it'll be wireframe.)  Just make the perspective view much easier to do...
