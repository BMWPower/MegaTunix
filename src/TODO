Write the gui routines for 
constants,
runtime display (data gathering works, but is not handled for display yet)
enrichments display/retrieval
ve table retrieval/display
tuning displays
Tools (reqd fuel calc, memory editor, TPS guage calibrator)
Datalogging gui and necessaru I/O functions. (will draw upon eXtace code)


Also not written yet is serial routines for VEtable/constants retrieval, 
as I don't have a map of how the data is laid out. (will use a struct once
I get the info...)

serial output routines for buring changes to the MS need to be written.
have not had time to research this yet..
