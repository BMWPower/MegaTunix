Tools (reqd fuel calc, memory editor, TPS guage calibrator)
Datalogging gui and necessaru I/O functions. (will draw upon eXtace code)

Also not written yet is serial routines for VEtable/constants retrieval, 
as I don't have a map of how the data is laid out. (will use a struct once
I get the info...)

serial output routines for burning changes to the MS need to be written.
have not had time to research this yet..
