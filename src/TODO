Tools (memory editor, TPS guage calibrator, others? )
Datalogging gui and necessary I/O functions. (will draw upon existing code)

Still needs tuning GUI.  Will probably end up starting yet another project
to design gui dashboard widgets for GTK and make a library for it..  Would
prefer to find out someone else alreay built it, and did it right...
Currently leaning towards libgnomecanvas. The Canvas seems extremely power-
full, though I'd like to see more documentation on it... The gauge-engien code
will probably use the canvas for rendering and XML to store the gauge "Themes"


Use gtkglext to display the VEtable in OpenGL. (should be too cpu intensive
as it'll be wireframe.)  Just make the perspective view much easier to do...
