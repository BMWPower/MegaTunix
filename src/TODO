Tools (memory editor, TPS guage calibrator, others? )
Datalogging gui and necessary I/O functions. (will draw upon eXtace code)

Still needs tuning GUI.  Will probably end up starting yet another project
to design gui dashboard widgets for GTK and make a library for it..  Would
prefer to find out someone else alreay built it, and did it right...

Currently leaning towards libgnomecanvas. The Canvas seems extremely power-
full, though I'd like to see more documentation on it...  Now that flash
burn works, I'll begin working on that...
