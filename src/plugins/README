This dir contains the per-ecu personality plugins, with functions and such
specific to this ECU family.  The two files personalities.c and plugins.c
in the upper lever src directory handle opening/loading the plugins and 
locating symbols within them.  It is VERY IMPORANT if you have glade tabs that
need to call functions within these plugins,  to have them INSTEAD call
"plugin_function" instead, and then in the corresponding .datamap.in create
a section for that widget, definining the ACTUAL function with this plugin
to be called,  i.e.

glade file defines control "special_button" to call function "special_handler"
Within glade, set the funct to be "plugin_function"
and in the datamap define it as follows:

[special_button]
keys=function_name
function_name=special_handler

plugins.c will lookup the symbol when needed and call the function, or spit
out an error if the function isn't found.
