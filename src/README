MegaTunix 0.0.x designed and written by Dave J. Andruczyk

Insiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel injection ECU. This code is 
modelled slight after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for MS-Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgreens' MegaTune
also for windows.

Right now the code is NON-function for everyday use.  What is working 
is basic serial input,  selection of serial port, testing MS comms works
Realtime data readback from the MS works. (but only dumps to console at
the moment as the gui has not caught up yet..). Saving of comm port
selection and windows position/size is saved automatically between runs
and is stored in ~/.MegaTunix/config.
