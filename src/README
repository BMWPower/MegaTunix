MegaTunix designed and written by David J. Andruczyk

	Inspiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel Injection ECU.  This code is 
modelled slightly after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgrens' MegaTune,
also for Windows.

NOTE about fonts:
	Some people have complained that MegaTunix comes up with abnormally
huge fonts.  This is NOT MegaTunix's fault.  It's caused by the default font
for Gnome being set to large.  This problem is mostly seen by people NOT 
using the Gnome desktop.   MegaTunix uses the GTK+2 libraries which are the 
foundation libraries by which Gnome's gui is based upon.  The fix is to run 
"gnome-font-properties" and set the "Application Font" size to a smaller 
point size.  On the authors' system a Application Font of "Sans" at 8pt, 
looks the best.  The author runs at 1600x1200 on an ancient 21 inch monitor 
so your ideal font size may vary.

	Currently all Serial I/O is working. Reading of Realtime vars works.  
Reading of VEtable/Constants works fine.  Changing any var checks for limits
and sends directly to the MS (new as of 5/25/2003). Flash burn works..
	As of July something-or-other,  datalogging is complete and works.
It's more flexible than any existing logging on any of the windows editions.
Currently it can do a MegaTune style "classic" datalog in the same format which
should be readable by mstweek3K (mstweek3k only runs under windows 
unfortunately). It can also log any of the runtime variables along with the 
addition of a high resolution clock which can be used to track things 
precisely in time...

NOTE: a new folder "Interrogation_profiles" exists in the src/ dir do not
fiddle with those files,  they are currently a work in progress. (7-26-2004)

The only things not done yet are the Tuning gui (graphical gauges, planned
implementation will use phot-realistic gauges that are graphically efficient
on resources with minimal cpu usage (without looking like crap..)

Suggestions are welcomed for improving the functionality of MegaTunix...
