MegaTunix 0.0.x designed and written by Dave J. Andruczyk

Insiration for this code came from Bruce Bowling and Al Grippo, 
designers of the MegaSquirt DIY Fuel injection ECU. This code is 
modelled slightly after Bruce and Al's MegaSquirt PCC tuning software 
for MS-Windows.  Inspiration also came from Eric Fahlgrens' MegaTune,
also for windows.

Right now the code is NON-function for everyday use.  What is working 
is basic serial input,  selection of serial port, testing MS comms works
Realtime data readback from the MS works.  Saving of comm port
selection and windows position/size is saved automatically between runs
and is stored in ~/.MegaTunix/config.

Serial I/O threads are pretty well tested, but since the MS has no form of
checksummarker in its output, it is possible to get out of sync causing the
realtime vars to scramble.  Every effort has been taken to catch this condition
and reinitialize the serial port.  If you have problems please contact me
<djandrucyk at yahoo dot com> and I'll see what I can do to get things 
behaving...
