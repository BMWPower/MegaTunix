Realtime variables

counter (byte 1 of 22)  (Seconds counter from CPU)
	NO CONVERSION necessary (data fed is in seconds)

squirt	(byte 2 of 22)  Bitfield
	Bit 1	injector 1  0=no squirt, 1=squirt
	Bit 2	injector 2  0=no squirt, 1=squirt
	Bit 3	injection 1 scheduled to squirt
	Bit 4	injection 1 firing
	Bit 5	injection 2 scheduled to squirt
	Bit 6	injection 2 firing
	Bit 7-8 reserved

engine	(byte 3 of 22)  Bitfield
	Bit 1(mask 0x1) engine running bit
	Bit 2(mask 0x2)	Cranking (RPM under 400)
	Bit 3(mask 0x4) With afterstart enrichment
	Bit 4(mask 0x8) In warmup enrichment mode
	Bit 5(mask 0x10) Acceleration (accel pump shot is active)
	Bit 6(mask 0x20) Deceleration (Coasting)
	Bits 7/8 undefined ???

baro	(byte 4 of 22)  Inital map reading on power up (baromter)
	Lookup table(s) (na or turbo) (from MegaSquirt PCC sourcecode)
	Hardcoded into megasquirtDlg.cpp
	value from MS is an index into the lookup table
	lookup table converts from ADC "counts" to KPA

map	(byte 5 of 22) MAP sensor reading
	Lookup table(s) (na or turbo) (from MegaSquirt PCC sourcecode)
	Hardcoded into megasquirtDlg.cpp
	value from MS is an index into the lookup table
	lookup table converts from ADC "counts" to KPA

mat	(byte 6 of 22) Manifold Air Temp
	Value returned is index into another lookup table -40
	(float)(thf[mat] - 40);

clt	(byte 7 of 22) Coolant Temp
	Value returned is index into another lookup table -40
	(float)(thf[mat] - 40); from Druntime.cpp
		OR
	output = (-.9706 * (RAW-32.48)+170.0)  (Dttune.cpp)	

tps	(byte 8 of 22) Throttle Position Sensor
	Value is stored twice, once raw, other converted to 
	0-5 volt value.

batt	(byte 9 of 22) Battery Voltage
	First converted to 0-5 volt value (raw *(5/255))
	Then multipled by 6

ego	(byte 10 of 22) Exhaust Gas Oxygen
	Value is converted to voltage (*5/255)
		
egocorr	(byte 11 of 22) Exhaust Gas Oxygen Correction
	RAW value used (no converstion)
		
aircorr	(byte 12 of 22) Air Temp Correction
	RAW value used (no converstion)
		
wamcorr	(byte 13 of 22) Warmup Correction
	RAW value used (no converstion)
		
rpm	(byte 14 of 22) Engine RPM
	RAW value * 100

pw	(byte 15 of 22) PulseWidth
	RAW value / 10

tpsaccel (byte 16 of 22) TPS Accell coefficient
	RAW value divided by 10
	
barocorr (byte 17 of 22) Barometer correction
	RAW value used (no converstion)

gammae	(byte 18 of 22) Sum of all enrichments
	RAW value used (no converstion)

vecurr	(byte 19 of 22) VE currently
	RAW value used (no converstion)

bspot1	(byte 20 of 22) Extra variable 1

bspot2	(byte 21 of 22) Extra variable 2

bspot3	(byte 22 of 22) Extra variable 3
