Note:

./configure, aclocal.m4, acinclude.m4, Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in and 
include/Makefile.in have been REMOVED.  You should run "autoreconf" followed
by "./configure" to regenerate these files.  Due to them being autobuilt
they should NOT be in CVS, as they impede the creation and application of 
patches to the developers tree...
