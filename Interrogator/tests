# How this works:
# Note, as of 8/1/2004 this is highly experimental and likely to change
# over the coming weeks
#
# the [interrogation_test] block defines the number of tests,  tests start
# as test 00 and progress upwards to testcount-1.
#
# NOTE!!! The tests are sequenced in such a way as to MATCH the sequence 
# listed inside each interrogation profile (see Profiles subdir) IF 
# you change the order AND/OR add more tests, then EACH interrogation 
# profile needs to be updated or BAD THINGS will happen. 
# You have been WARNED!!!
#
#
# Each seperate interrogation test is labeled [test_XX} where XX is any number
# between zero and testcount-1 inclusive.
# Fields allowed inside [test_XX} blocks:
#
#	raw_cmd		<-- (String) This is the ascii value sent to the ECU
#	cmd_desc	<-- (String) This is displayed in the interrogator 
#			window and is a brief description of the command sent.
#	cmd_length	<-- (Int) Length of command sent to the ECU in bytes
#	multipart	<-- (bool) This means that the write to the ECU has 
#			two components, a command and an arg. (see cmd_int_arg)
#	cmd_int_arg	<-- (int) the argument sent AFTER the command, used 
#			only seldomly for things like RAW mem read.
#	store_data	<-- (bool), true to save return vals or false to ignore
#	store_type	<-- (String) Only _SIG_ , _VNUM_ , or _TEXTVER_ are
#			allowed here...
