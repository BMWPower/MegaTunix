This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, Sept 19th 16:04 PM

	Inside this dir "Profiles", contains several files with a ".prof" 
and a extension.  The .prof files are MegaTunix's interrogation profiles
used to match against and load up a whole slew of parameters specific to the
Firmware being used by megatunix
The profile is laid out in .ini file format using the common "section",
"key","value" layout as shown below.


[section]
key=value

What MegaTunix does, is that after it starts it checks to make sure an ECU
is present by issuing a comms test. (sends a "C" and checks for a response)
If that succeeds, Mtx then procedes to interrogate the ECU.  It does this
by reading a list of tests from a config file. This configuration file is
stored by default in /usr/local/share/MegaTunix/Interrogator/tests. After
reading and validating the file MegaTunix will send the commands
to the ECU in turn and record the responses.  Once all the responses are 
gathered, MegaTunix will load each interrogation profile in sequence, and 
attempt to match what it recorded with the profile,  once an exact match is 
found it will load up the detailed firmware information (load_firmware_details)
allocate memory for datastructures and exit from the interrogation routines
and kick off several routines to read a current block of data from the ECU for 
all pages and populate the GUI

NOTES regarding the profile files:

The value names are CaSe SeNsItIvE, so be warned.  Ironically the
keys themselves are not, as the string compare functions are case insensitive.

Sections:
[interrogation_profile]
 - Contains only 1 key which is "name". The name is an arbritrarily long string
 and it used to match against in the RealTimeMap files and for backup and
restoration of ECU settings. (see the Tools Tab)

[parameters]
SignatureQueryString
  - This is a substring to match against for the ECU if it responds to the
  "S" (signature) command, if your firmware doesn't support the S command just
  leave this one's value empty

ExtVerQueryString
  - This is a substring to match against for the ECU if it responds to the
  "?" (Ext version) command, if your firmware doesn't support the ? command just
  leave this one's value empty

VerNumber
  - This is an integer number to match against what the ECU returns to the "Q"
  (query version) Command

Capabilities
  - This is an enumeration not used by most firmwares.  It's best to leave this
  one's value blank

Rt_Cmd_Key
  - This maps to a code regarding the command sent to the ECU to retrieve the
  RealTime Variables.  the Codes follow the following formula:
    CMD_ (prefix), UPPER/LOWER (means upper or lower case), "_A" means the
    letter sent to the ECU, so "CMD_UPPER_A" means send an "A" to get the data.
    Wherease a "CMD_LOWER_X" would send an "x" instead.

VE_Cmd_Key
  - This maps to a code to retreive the VE/Constants block of data.  See above
  for code specifications.

Ign_Cmd_Key
  - This maps to a code to retrieve the Ignition/Constants block of data.  
  THIS COMMAND is specific to the MSnEDIS and MSnSPARK (not extra) series
  firmwares and should NOT be used for newer firmwares as the paging method
  is preferred.

Write_CMD
  - This is a single char sent to the ECU to Write data. The write algorithm 
  uses a Write+offset+data syntax internally.

Burn_CMD 
  - This is a single char sent to the ECU to Burn RAM contents to flash.

MultiPage
  - This is a boolean, and means the firmware suports multiple pages of data.
  NOTE: for MSnS/MSnEDIS which don't use the normal paging algorithm, they
  are still considered MultiPage, see the RequirePageChange for more info.

RequirePageChange
  - Boolean, If set to True, Page changing is done. (ecu responds to the 
  Page_CMD).  MSnS/MSnEDIS have this set to FALSE as they use alternate 
  commands to modify data in the higher pages, see "is_spark".

Page_CMD
  - A string sent to the ECU followed by an argument to change the current
  page in the ECU. Used prior to sending data to the ECU or retrieveing the
  VE/Constants block from the ECU when MultiPAge is TRUE and RequirePageChange
  is TRUE.

TotalTables
  - An Integer stating the number of TABLES in the VE/Constants blocks.  A 
  Table is a grouped block of datat consisting of 3 parts, an RPM group, a
  Load group (TPS/MAP) and a Table itself.   for example the GH DT-1.02 
  firmware has two independant VEtables,  thus it has TotalTables set to 2.

TotalPages
  - An integer stating how many pages of data this firmware is capable of
  handling.  This is firmware dependant.



[table_x] sections, 1 per table as defined by TotalTables
is_spark
  - Boolean,  if this table is a spark table and uses the unusualy 2.84 
  conversion factor then this flag is set to TRUE, otherwise FALSE.

table_name
  - String, a Textual name used for the Title of the 3D table editor window
  Used to help the user differentiate which tabel they are editing at any one
  time...

rpm_page
  - Integer, lists the page number that the rpm array lives in

load_page
  - Integer, lists the page number that the load array lives in

tbl_page
  - Integer, lists the page number that the tbl array lives in

tbl_base_offset
  - Integer, The offset from the base of page (above) that this table starts
  at.  The total length of the table is rpm_bincount*load_bincount, and is 
  sequentially addressed.

rpm_base_offset
  - Integer, The offset from the pase of page (Above) that the RPM array 
  starts at.  Length of this array is rpm_bincount

load_base_offset
  - Integer, The offset from the pase of page (Above) that the LOAD array 
  starts at.  Length of this array is load_bincount

rpm_bincount
  - Integer, the size of the RPM array

load_bincount
  - Integer, the size of the LOAD array


[page_x] sections, 1 per page as defined by TotalPages
length 
  - Integer, length of the page in variables. (not bytes, data is stored 
  internally in megatunix as a 32 bit signed integer)

is_spark
  - Boolean, a Flag that when FALSE requires the following fields to be
  present: reqfuel_offset, divider_offset, alternate_offset, rpmk_offset,
  cfg11_offset, cfg12_offset, cfg13_offset.

NOTES regarding reqfuel_offset, divider_offset, alternate_offset, 
  rpmk_offset,cfg11_offset, cfg12_offset, cfg13_offset, spconfg_offset.

  These above parameters are the offset locations from the beginning of the 
  page. They are MegaSquirt firmware specific.  If you have added support for
  a NON MS ecu (VEMS) that does NOT make use of the internal functions that
  use these variables, then they should all be set to -1 (NOT zero as that
  will cause problems wiht the widget associated with offset zero).
  

[gui] section
RealTimeMapFile
  - String, The name of the realtime map file (sans extension)

SliderMapFile
  - String, The name of the rtsliders map file (sans extension)

LoadTabs
  - Comma Separated list.  A list of GLADE files to load in sequence for this 
  firmware. See TabConfs for hte matching list of config files that go with 
  this list of glade files.

TabConfs
  - Comma Separated List. A list of DATAMAP files to load for each of the above
  glade files in the LoadTabs key.  The number of args in this list MUST match
  the LoadTabs line otherwise an error will be reported...


[lookuptables] section
tables
  - Comma Separated List. A list of KEYS to be loaded to get the lookuptables
  used inside megatunix (and most specifically, by the RealTimeMaps)

The lookuptables are loaded as a key/value pair
for example.  wbo2_table=NBafr100.inc
Internally a table will be created that is referred by name as wb02_table, and
it will be populated with the contents of NBafr100.inc.  Any number of 
lookuptables can be loaded. Adjsut the "tables=" line as needed to load 
additional tables..
