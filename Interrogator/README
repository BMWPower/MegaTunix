This README describes the contents of this dir and their file structure.

Last Edited, Feb 27th 2005

	Inside this dir "Interrogator", contains two files, this README
and a "tests" file.  The tests file is laid out in .ini file format using 
the common "section", "key","value" layout as shown below.

[section]
key=value

What MegaTunix does, is that after it starts it checks to make sure an ECU
is present by issuing a comms test. (sends a "C" and checks for a response)
If that succeeds, Mtx then procedes to interrogate the ECU.  Before it can
interrogate, it needs to know waht to send to the ECU.  This "tests" file
defines those commands. See below for descriptions of the various fields 
within the file.

NOTES regarding the file:
The value names are CaSe SeNsItIvE, so be warned.  Ironically the
keys themselves are not, as the string compare functions are case insensitive.

Sections:
interrogation_tests
 - Contains only 1 key,  "total_tests" which is an integer.  It's the total
 number of tests t oload and store and use against the ECU.

test_xx
 - There is one section per test, sections are named with an integer suffix 
 starting from 00 and going up to total_tests-1.

test_xx fields:
 raw_cmd
  - This is a string of the command to send to the ECU. it should NOT be quoted
 
 cmd_length
  - The number of bytes this command is,  99% of the commands are 1 byte in 
  length.

 cmd_desc
  - String displayed on screen in the General tab during interrogation to 
  describe the command sent to the ECU.

 store_data
  - Boolean, to flag if data is to be stored for display in a seperate field.
  Used to store the signature, extended revision and version number retrieved
  from the ECU

 store_type
  - String represnetation of an enumeration.  Valid types are ONLY _TEXTVER_,
  _SIG_, and _VNUM_
