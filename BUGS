LOGVIEWER
 Current logviewer is a POS and is to be scrapped and rewritten using the 
 newly designed stripchart widgets (and may the piegauges as well)

3D VE/Spark/AFR/Other tables
 Users with Intel graphicson linux have reported the GL view appears 
 distorted, text is missing, or it otherwise renders in a abnormal way.
 This is an INTEL OpenGL bug in their linux implementation.  The only
 workaround I'm aware of is to try a different driver version (advanced users
 only)
