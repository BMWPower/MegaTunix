For those that downloaded a tarball. (i.e. NOT from CVS) run the compile,
build/install three-step.

untar it (you've obviously already did this if you're reading this file...)

./configure
make
make install (as root or via sudo) <-- required for MegaTunix to work

For those that used CVS
first update your tree:
	cvs update -dP
Then regenerate things that aren't in CVS (And should NOT be)
	./autogen.sh

The build as above (./configure;make;make install)

a "make uninstall" will remove all files created that "make install" placed
on your system.  It will NOT remove directories though.  so if you want
to get rid of everything delete /usr/local/share/MegaTunix (assumes you ran
./configure with no options to change the default prefix of "/usr/local")
