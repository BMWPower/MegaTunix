MS-2 (115200 baud)
FreeEMS (??? baud)

Choice determine's serial port speed, interrogation tests, and
comm.xml choice

port speed and interrogation tests are critical, comm.xml could in theory
be picked up from the interrogation result in the case of same family
but semi-conflicting API's




Add full MS-II support including CAN submodules (requires internal core 
modifications to handle the arrays for CAN controls.
 - Update: feb '08  
 Core work for ms-2 data completed. 
 canID stuff, partially done, needs testing with an actual MS-2 
 and Can submodule.
 
Add full offline playback mode selectable at any time. to allow playback of 
logs with visual feeedback in 2d/3d views, and dashes.  Requires designing 
parser/mapper to link datamap fields to internal datasource names.
- Still being thought about

Socket API
 - Completed and working, but clunky. Needs re-thinking and a better data-
model.  May consider incorporating CSimpleSocket, which abstracts away a
lot of the network-ness.
