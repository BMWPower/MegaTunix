Custom designed gauge widget initially designed by Christopher Mire (czb83).
Design was enhanced by David Andruczyk and then incorporated code from Ari
(msgauge) and greatly enhanced in terms of look, feel and overall performance
Currently has a rich api and attribute set allowing some very attractive 
gauges to be created.
